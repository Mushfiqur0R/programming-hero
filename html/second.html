<p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as <small>JavaScript </small> , <em>which </em> <strong> affects   </strong>  the behavior and content of web pages.</p> The inclusion of <strong>CSS</strong>  defines the look and <em>layout</em>  of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.
